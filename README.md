# SimpleModBot

**Setup**:

1. Install Python 3.5 or higher (if you don't already have it)

2. Go [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and set up an application. Retrieve the bot's token and use it in `bot.run(token)`.

3. Run the bot; it will provide a link in the console to invite the bot to your server. This can be done through `python3 SimpleModBot.py` or `py SimpleModBot.py`, depending on your operating system.
